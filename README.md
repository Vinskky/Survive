## Welcome to survive

Survive is a game developed by two UPC students for the subject of artificial inteligence. During this subject we had to design and 
program an environment to acomplish all what we learned during the subject.

We implemented a survivor game mixing some tower defense elements where the player has to survive all the enemies wave that come and 
try to whipeout the shelter. 

You lose when the barreier breaks by the zombies and win when you manage to make that all the villagers of the shelter survive by going to the rescue helicopter. 

The game focus on the management of all kind of resources that villagers recolect during the day.
